# Recycling glass

 

In the UK a typical family uses around 500 glass jars and bottles each year; this makes up approximately 10.4% of annual household waste.

Glass is completely recyclable and can be continuously reused and recycled an unlimited number of times with no reduction in quality. However, in the UK current glass recycling rates are at just 44%. This figure compares poorly to the glass recycling rates of many other European countries, some of which recycle up to 80% or even 90% of their glass annually.

There are a number of benefits in recycling glass rather than continually producing more, for example much less energy is required to melt and recycle existing glass compared to producing new glass from raw materials. A light bulb can be powered for up to one hour by using the energy that is saved from recycling one glass bottle. Additionally, recycling glass conserves the raw materials that are used to make it, and is therefore more environmentally friendly.

Glass which is not recycled goes into landfill sites. By disposing of glass in landfill the potential energy of the glass bottles and jars is stored underground and goes to waste. As it is not biodegradable, glass will remain in the ground indefinitely, taking up landfill space.


# Utopia! - The magazine for the future

 

UTOPIA is now established as Britain's most influential ecology orientated magazine. Its circulation has risen steadily every year since its launch seven years ago and now equals that of the most popular women's fashion magazines.

UTOPIA tells you what is happening on your planet NOW. We were the first to publish government figures on North Sea pollution. We were also a major catalyst for creating world-wide awareness of the hole in the ozone layer.

UTOPIA also provides helpful and practical information on natural health issues. Past features span from reflexology and nutrition to meditation and natural family planning.

UTOPIA'S talented and forward thinking editorial team has been drawn from all over the world. Our Japanese Art Director was previously the Art Editor of Visage magazine and we are very proud to have Margaret Shymer as our new Editor. Margaret spent many years as the Editor of America's Living magazine, then helped to establish the 'Green Movement' in the UK, before coming to UTOPIA.

UTOPIA is printed on recycled paper and we make use of the most advanced technology in the printing processes to ensure that wastage is minimised. UTOPIA is published monthly at a cover price of £2.50.

# Through the roof – Reducing carbon dioxide emissions through loft insulation

 

Every year, a quarter of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions result from the energy we use within our homes. This means that reducing the energy we waste at home reduces our personal contribution to climate change.

A large proportion of the heat that escapes from our homes goes through our roofs. Loft insulation can reduce our heating bills by up to 25%. Once it's done, the savings in energy waste and the reductions in carbon dioxide emissions continue year after year.

Lofts should be insulated to a depth of 250 mm. Typically a roll of insulating material is used, which you can fit yourself. Alternatively, loose insulating materials can be used to fill the spaces between joists.

If you are going to insulate the loft yourself, make sure you wear protective goggles and gloves together with a face mask, because insulation materials can be abrasive for eyes, skin and throat.

In a typical home, loft insulation will save you £50-100 each year.
